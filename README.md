# Columbia-ACTU-5841-Project
Final Group Project for ACTU 5841 - Data Science in Finance And Insurance
## Our Dataset:

For the final project for data science for finance and insurance we decided to work on a dataset to predict bankruptcy in companies based on different financial ratios that describe the financial health of a company. The definition of bankruptcy was the one provided by the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we obtained the dataset from Kaggle, the publisher of the original dataset is the National Central University of Taiwan.

The dataset was composed of 96 columns, one of them was if the company was either bankrupt or not defined by 1 (bankrupt) and 0 (non-bankrupt). The other 95 features were different financial ratios related to the return on different measures, other macro-economic factors, and the different margins that a company may have at different operating levels.

Here is an example of some of the features to get an idea of what they are. First, we have the net income to total assets, which tells us how much revenue a company has generated divided by the assets that helped brin that income. Second, Net worth to assets which tells us how much the company is worth divided by its assets. Third, Gross profit to sales, this feature is the income after subtracting the costs of the products sold divided by the total revenue. Also called Gross profit margin. Then, there is the debt ratio that measures how much a company is leveraged and is calculated by dividing total liabilities to total assets. And the last example is the ROA, which is the return on assets that a company may have either before or after applying taxes.

We choose to make our project on bankruptcy because we believe that bankruptcy in a business is a significant risk not only to the individual enterprise that is going under, but also to the broader global economy. Our approach focuses on a comprehensive analysis of various Key Performance indicators that are indicative of a company’s financial health to predict if the company has the possibility of going bankrupt. When this problem goes unaddressed, these indicators can lead to a company’s downfall and have major consequences in many people’s lives.

The core objective with this project is to develop a robust predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the likelihood of a company facing bankruptcy. This tool will be instrumental in enabling businesses to make informed and timely decisions, potentially averting financial crisis and contributing to overall economic stability.
